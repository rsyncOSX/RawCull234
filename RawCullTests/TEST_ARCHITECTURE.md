# RawCullVerify Test Architecture

RawCullVerify tests use the Swift Testing framework. The suite is intended to stay
small enough to run regularly and strict enough that passing tests represent
real application behavior, not test-framework setup checks.

## Test Categories

- Smoke tests: fast deterministic checks carrying `.tags(.smoke)`. The
  `selectedTags` entry in `Smoke.xctestplan` is the sole selector used by
  `make test-smoke`; there is no parallel Makefile suite list.
- Full tests: all test files with Thread Sanitizer enabled through
  `make test-full`. The full plan is serialized because it deliberately mixes
  tests of process-wide caches, settings, and other singleton state; smoke
  tests remain parallelizable.
- Performance / stress tests: the dedicated extreme-concurrency data-race
  check selected by `make test-performance`. This is not a timing benchmark
  unless a future test adds explicit duration assertions.

When adding a smoke test, add `.tags(.smoke)` directly to its `@Test`
declaration. Keep smoke tests deterministic, isolated, and suitable for every
developer checkout. Do not add a second suite manifest or `-only-testing`
entry for smoke coverage. Thread Sanitizer belongs only to the full gate.

## Shared Test Base

All tests should start from an explicit, isolated base rather than the app's
production singletons or user-visible directories. The shared helpers live in
`TestIsolationHelpers.swift`:

- `makeIsolatedCache()` creates a `SharedMemoryCache` with thumbnail and full-size
  JPEG disk caches rooted under a unique `RawCullVerifyTests/<test-name>-<UUID>`
  temporary directory.
- `makeIsolatedThumbnailProvider()` returns a `RequestThumbnail` wired to an
  isolated cache for request/cache tests.
- `makeIsolatedSettingsViewModel()` returns a `SettingsViewModel` backed by a
  unique temporary `settings.json` path and skips production settings loading.

Use these helpers whenever a test touches shared cache, disk cache, thumbnail,
or settings state. Tests that need lower-level fixtures may define private
factory functions in their own file, but those factories should follow the same
base rule: unique temporary paths, synthetic data, and no dependency on a user's
real photo library, settings, cache, or Documents folder.

The only tests that should intentionally touch singleton-like shared state are
Thread Sanitizer stress tests, and those tests must make that intent obvious in
the suite name, tag, or test body.

## Quality Bar

- Tests should assert RawCullVerify behavior or state transitions directly.
- Manual diagnostics, local-path RAW-file probes, templates, and console-only checks
  do not belong in the automated target.
- Placeholder assertions such as `#expect(true)` should be removed or replaced with
  assertions against production APIs.
- Shared state tests should use isolated temporary caches/settings unless they are
  deliberately exercising the singleton under Thread Sanitizer.
- Unit tests should target parser, math, cache, concurrency, persistence, and
  view-model behavior. Pure SwiftUI rendering/layout, the `RawCullVerifyApp` entry
  point, simple display-only models, and live process integrations belong outside
  this unit target unless they gain meaningful business logic.

## Current Focus Areas

- RawCullVerify integration behavior around imported RAW parsing packages.
- Thumbnail request/cache behavior, cancellation, and loader concurrency bounds.
- Sharpness and similarity scoring numeric behavior.
- View-model navigation, zoom overlay, and security-scoped path behavior.
- TSan-oriented stress tests for RawCullVerify shared cache state.

## Current Test Files

- `CullingModelTests.swift`: rating/tagging state transitions, file selection, and
  culling model behavior.
- `DiskCacheAndScanAdmissionTests.swift`: thumbnail/full-size disk cache behavior
  and scan admission decisions using temporary cache roots.
- `ThumbnailRequestKeyTests.swift`: source replacement, representation sizing,
  schema migration, metadata failure, and atomic/cancelled disk-cache behavior.
- `ThumbnailPreloadGridGateTests.swift`: catalog-bound grid blocking and shared
  extraction instrumentation, including duplicate and cancellation counters.
- `HistogramLoadingTests.swift`: recoverable conversion, clearing, and
  latest-selection-wins behavior for histogram calculation.
- `RawCullVerifyTestsConcurrencyTests.swift`: isolated shared cache counters and settings
  persistence/concurrency behavior.
- `RawCullVerifyTestsDataRaceDetectionTests.swift`: TSan-focused shared cache stress
  coverage that deliberately exercises concurrent access paths.
- `RawCullVerifyViewModelSecurityScopeTests.swift`: security-scoped catalog access
  lifecycle behavior on the `@MainActor` `RawCullViewModel`.
- `ScanAndExtractJPGsTests.swift`: scan/extraction coordination behavior.
- `ScanFilesSortAndFormatTests.swift`: file sorting and display formatting rules.
- `SharpnessScoringTests.swift`: sharpness scoring, focus-mask numeric helpers,
  aperture hints, and ISO scaling.
- `ThumbnailLoaderConcurrencyTests.swift`: thumbnail loader concurrency bounds and
  cancellation under stress.
- `ThumbnailProviderTests.swift`: thumbnail request/cache behavior, cache config,
  and cached thumbnail cost.
